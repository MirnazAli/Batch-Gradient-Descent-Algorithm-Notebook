# Gradient Descent Algorithm Notebook
This Github repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements the basic gradient descent algorithm, a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning for training various models, such as linear regression and neural networks. The notebook is written in Python and uses popular scientific computing libraries, including NumPy and Matplotlib.

In the notebook, you will find a step-by-step implementation of the gradient descent algorithm, which iteratively adjusts the model's parameters to minimize the cost function. The implementation includes a detailed explanation of the algorithm, including how to calculate the gradient and how to update the model parameters.

Additionally, the notebook provides an example of applying gradient descent to linear regression problems. You can follow along with the examples and see how gradient descent can be used to optimize the models' parameters and improve their performance.

The code is well-documented and easy to follow, making it a great starting point for building your own machine learning models with gradient descent.

Kindly upload the CSV file to the path in which the Notebook will be run for successful execution of the code.
