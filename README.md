# Batch Gradient Descent Algorithm Notebook
This Github repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that implements the batch gradient descent algorithm, a popular optimization algorithm used in machine learning for training various models, such as linear regression and neural networks. The notebook is written in Python and uses popular scientific computing libraries, including NumPy and Matplotlib.

In the notebook, you will find a step-by-step implementation of the batch gradient descent algorithm, which iteratively adjusts the model's parameters to minimize the cost function. The implementation includes a detailed explanation of the algorithm, including how to calculate the gradient and how to update the model parameters.

Additionally, the notebook provides examples of applying batch gradient descent to linear regression and logistic regression problems. You can follow along with the examples and see how batch gradient descent can be used to optimize the models' parameters and improve their performance.

Whether you're new to machine learning or a seasoned practitioner, this notebook provides a valuable resource for understanding the batch gradient descent algorithm and how to apply it to different problems. The code is well-documented and easy to follow, making it a great starting point for building your own machine learning models with batch gradient descent.
